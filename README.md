# JournAll

### About 
This is a smart journal that allows one to record their day along with important health stats and has several views to show summaries of their entries 
so they can track their progress overtime. However this journal has a twist where we recommend youtube videos based on how the user was feeling that day.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this was that due to the pandemic, it is really easy to be overwhelmed with everything going on. We had done some perlinimary research and 
found that journalling has many benifits so we wanted to create a journalling website to allow users to track their emotions and health stats.
